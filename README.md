# Twitter Scheduler

This project was born as a Master's Dissertation, it is based in the implementation of an application using Trunk-based development with two new features applying Feature toggles and Branch by abstraction design techniques.

Application has been implemented with Java 11 using Spring Boot and following a hexagonal architecture applying Domain Driven Design, it provides the capacity to schedule the publication of tweets in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) social network in this account: [BlueOcean_TFM](https://twitter.com/BlueOcean_TFM)

On every commit, a GitHub actions workflow is executed, running unitary and integration tests, publishing the docker image in [DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/drojo/twitter-scheduler-tfm) and deploying the application in [Heroku](https://twitter-scheduler-tfm.herokuapp.com/) (credentials needed), also a pair of smoke tests are executed in order to confirm that the application has been successfully deployed.
